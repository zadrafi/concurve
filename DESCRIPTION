Description: Allows one to compute compatibility (confidence)
    intervals for various statistical tests along with their corresponding
    P-values, S-values, and likelihoods. The intervals can be plotted to
    create consonance, surprisal, and likelihood functions allowing one to
    see what effect sizes are compatible with the test model at various
    compatibility levels rather than being limited to one interval estimate
    such as 95%. Functions can also be compared to one another to see how much
    they overlap with one another and differ. Results can also be exported for 
    Word, Powerpoint, and TeX documents. The package currently supports bootstrapping,
    linear models, generalized linear models, linear mixed-effects models, 
    survival analysis, and meta-analysis. These methods are discussed by
